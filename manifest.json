Game by <b>Tom Hermans (@Auroriax). \n\nHow to play (Arrow keys/WASD/ZQSD/Swipes):ðŸ¡¸ ðŸ¡º: Flying kick, ðŸ¡¹ ðŸ¡»: Slow/fasten fall.\n Touched platforms move to background and increase jackpot. Reach bottom of level to claim jackpot and flip to the backside! You lose when time runs out... \n\nCoil subscribers can play the game with a different color palette! Or should I say...
